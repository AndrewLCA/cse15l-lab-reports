## Reverse Array Method ## 
**Failure Inducing Test Cases**
```
@Test 
	public void testReverseInPlaceOdd() {
    int[] input1 = { 3,2,1 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 1,2,3 }, input1);
	}

  @Test 
  public void testReverseInPlaceEven()
  {
    int[] input1 = {1,2,3,4}; 
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[] {4, 3,2,1}, input1);
  }
```
**Test Case without Failure**
```
@Test 
  public void testReverseInPlace()
  {
    int[] input1 = {1}; 
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[] {1}, input1);
  }
```

**Reverse Array Code with Bug**
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
  ```

**Reverse Array Code without Bugs**
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length/2; i ++) 
    {
      int temp = arr[i]; 
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
      arr[arr.length - i - 1] = temp; 
    }
  }
```
In the original code, you are not able to directly swap the values of two array indexes. Thus, a temp variable was created storing the value of the first index. Since the first index is now empty, the last value of the array is placed into it. The last index is then set to the value in temp. Since two indexes are being changed every iteration, the maximum amount of iterations should be length/2.

andrewlu@Andrews-Laptop docsearch % find technical/government/About_LSC -type f -delete
andrewlu@Andrews-Laptop docsearch % ls technical/government/About_LSC
```
```
Andrews-Laptop:technical andrewlu$ ls
911report       biomed          government      plos            test
Andrews-Laptop:technical andrewlu$ find . -delete 
Andrews-Laptop:technical andrewlu$ ls
```
This command line option traverses through all found files/directories and deletes them. As seen in the first code block, all files were deleted from the `About_LSC` directory by the `-type f`, while the second code block shows all files and directories deleted from `technical` directory.

**`find . -type d empty` command**

```
andrewlu@Andrews-Laptop technical % find . -type d -empty 
./empty directory
```
```
andrewlu@Andrews-Laptop plos % find . -type f -empty
./empty file
```
This command line option finds all empty files/directories. In the first code block, an empty directory was created and by using `-type d` it searches up empty directories. While in the second code block, using `-type f` searches up empty files.

**`find . -type d -mtime 0` command**

```
andrewlu@Andrews-Laptop technical % find . -type d -mtime 0

This command line option searches up the file of the specific type. `-type f` would mean files while `-type d` would refer to directories.
